# Causality
## Overview

In the context of [[Model of Special Relativity | special relativity]] we assume that the causal structure of the universe is preserved (as was previously thought so in [[Newtonian Framework]]).
## Development

Causality in special relativity is more of a possibility than an actuality. When we speak of causation in the context of special relativity we imply the following:

We'd assumed that nothing can go faster than the speed of light (or if it does it won't be interacting with the slower material). Therefore, for the effect of an event to reach a point in space time, it should be reaching in the manner that the speed of it won't exceed the speed of light.

Therefore, there can be assume two [[Lightcones]]for each event, one coming from the past reflecting on everything that could affect the event, and one going forward in future showcasing all the events that would possibly be affected by the event itself.
