# Luminiferous Ether
## Overview

Luminiferous Ether is a hypothetical medium for electromagnetic waves.
## Development

In 1865 James Clerk Maxwell put forward the theory of electromagnetism. One important result from this theory was the discovery that light if in nature, oscillations of the electromagnetic fields.

Since all known waves in physics were required a material medium in which the oscillations were carried, it was postulated that there exists one for light as well. *An all-pervading medium, called the luminiferous ether*, which carried the oscillations of electromagnetism.

It was then a logical step to think that one can find the absolute motion of the ether through experiments with light. 

Such hopes made dull when the results of every experiment came null. Most importantly (both historically and experimentally) the [[Michelson-Morley Experiment]] in 1881, which attempted to measure the velocity of the Earth relative to the ether and found it to be undetectably small.

These were explained by adding two ad hoc hypotheses by Lorentz, Fitzgerald and Poincare, namely [[Lorentz's Ether Theory]].
