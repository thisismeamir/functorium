# Kerr Metric Analysis

## Overview
We're working on analyzing Kerr Metric in Toroidal Coordinates. **==This project is halted due to the fact that there already exists a paper on this topic.==**
## Investigation
- [x] **Report 1**: âœ… 2025-05-23
      Provide a single Mathematica Notebook where:
	- You provide toroidal coordinate transformations for Minkowski, Schwarzshield and Kerr.
	- You examine extreme cases for Kerr and Schwarzshield (no mass, no rotation, and far source cases).
	- You provide a clear documentation of the process.
