# Electromagnetism in 17th and 18th centuries (Historical overview)
## Overview
The investigators in the seventeenth and the first part of the eighteenth centuries were confronted by a confused collection of phenomena, such as frictional electricity, formation of sparks, and effect of atmospheric moisture, which they were unable to clarify because of the lack of fundamental electrostatic concepts.
## Development
- In 1731, Stephen Gray (1670-1736) recognized the difference between conductors and insulators.

- In 1759 Franz Ulrich Theodor Aepinus (1724-1802) went further by showing the existence of all stages of transition between them. They made the first observations of the influence exerted by charges bodies on insulated conductors.

- Ewald George von Kleist (born soon after 1700, died 1748) and Pieter van Musschenbroek (1692-1761) were led by chance observation in 1745 to Leyden jar, the original form of the electrical condenser, whose elucidation occupied not only Aepinus but also Benjamin Franklin.

- In 1758 Johann Carl Wilcke discovered the polarization of dielectrics, a typical instance of a premature and therefore, quickly forgotten fact.

- Alessandro Count Volta (1745-1827) described in 1775 the electrophorus from which influence electrical machines were later developed.

- In 1752 Franklin furnished the experimental proof of the electrical nature of thunder storms, a fact that had long been suspected


- The concept *quantity of electricity* seems to have been current since the seventeenth century, and without any real basis from the start was connected with the idea of impossibility of creating or destroying electricity ([[Charge Conservation]]). The dispute as to whether there are two electrical *fluids* which compensate each other in their effects, or only one, which is present in an electrically neutral body in a certain normal quantity, could not be decided.

- In 1778 Anton Brugmans (1732-1789) discovered diamagnetism, when he found that bismuth is repelled by a magnet.

- In eighteenth century there was really only one discovery concerning magnetism, and it too was premature and consequently ineffective. 

- Electricity got the rank of a science when [[Coulomb's law]] was discovered. 

- This law began with suspicions related to the Newtonian law of attraction.

- In 1767 Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) found compelling evidence of it in the discovery by him and others.

- For instance, they've discovered that the charge of a conductor resides entirely on its surface, while the interior remains completely free of all electrical influences. However this fact received no attention.

- In 1785 Augustin de Coulomb (1786-1806) made measurements with a torsion balance; he determined the force between charged spheres, partly by means of the static deflection of the balance, and partly through the vibration period, about its rest point, of a sphere suspended from the balance and set in motion by the action of the fixed sphere.

- Coulomb reported that a conductor also shields its interior (since he was not aware of the predecessors) .

- Coulomb also extended this idea to magnetism as well. Though for this case, the experiments were less convincing.

- The progress of Coulomb's law was shown in 1811, when Simeon Denis Poisson carried the theory of potential which was first developed for gravitation.

- The further elaboration of the theory of potential was due, in addition to Green, to Karl FriedrichFriedrich Gauss, who published a famous work in 1839.

- The law of the conservation of electricity was first demonstrated in 1843 by Faraday. 

- The second and perhaps more fruitful advance was made by the science of electricity when Alessandro Count Volta transformed into a physical Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), which had aroused much interest and had stimulated many successors.
