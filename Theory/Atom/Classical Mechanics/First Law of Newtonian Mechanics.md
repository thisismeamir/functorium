# First Law of Newtonian Mechanics
## Overview
Newtonian theory postulates the existence of preferred frames of reference. The existence of these is essentially implied by the first law,

> Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces acting on it.

Thus, there exists a privileged set of bodies, namely, those not acted on by forces. The frame of reference of co-moving observer is called an [[Inertial Frame]].
