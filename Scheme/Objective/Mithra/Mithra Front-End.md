# Mithra Front-End

## Overview
Mithra front-end [repo](https://github.com/iskdevelop/mithra-frontend). Is the front-end module of mithra, this has a great bottleneck called [[Scheme/Objective/Runik/Runik|Runik]] to be completed first. But for now we focus on some aspects of it that are useful.
## Investigation
- [ ] **Development of components for Mithra**:
      Aside from modules and development practices, Mithra needs a component set, both from Nukleus Design system and some for it's own. Modules should be coherent and behave the same.
- [ ] **Analysis and Project Management**:
      We should make sure that we have a rigid plan for the publish of the product. There's still a lot of time remaining until we reach it but we need to have a good plan.
