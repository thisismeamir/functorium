# Restricted Principle of Special Relativity

The relativity principle by essence underpins Newtonian theory


> [!DANGER] Restricted Principle of Special Relativity
> All inertial observers are equivalent as far as dynamical experiments are concerned

## Definition

The Restricted Principle of Special Relativity states that all inertial observers are equivalent as far as dynamical experiments are concerned. This means that if one inertial observer conducts a set of experiments and discovers a physical law, then any other inertial observer performing the same experiments must arrive at the same conclusion.

## Consequences

* **Equivalence of inertial observers**: All inertial observers are equivalent in terms of the laws they observe. This means that the results of experiments performed by one inertial observer must be the same as those performed by another inertial observer.
* **Invariance under Galilean transformations**: The laws of physics must be invariant under a Galilean transformation. This means that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, regardless of their relative motion.

## Mathematical Formulation

Let's denote the spacetime coordinates as $(x, y, z, t)$, and the relative velocity between two inertial observers as $\vec{v}$. The Restricted Principle of Special Relativity can be mathematically formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}'$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{L}'$ are the laws of physics observed by two inertial observers, and the prime symbol denotes the transformed coordinates.

This mathematical formulation ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, regardless of their relative motion.

## Physical Interpretation

The Restricted Principle of Special Relativity has profound physical implications. It shows that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, regardless of their relative motion. This means that the concept of absolute time and space is not valid, and that the laws of physics are relative to the observer's frame of reference.

Einstein realized that the principle as stated above is empty because there's no such thing as a purely dynamical experiment. Even on a very elementary level, any dynamical experiment we thing of performing involves observation. **Looking is a part of optics, and optics is not dynamics.**

Thus, Einstein took the logical step of removing the restriction of dynamics in the principle and took the following as his first postulate:
