# Runik
## Context
Editing content is an unavoidable part of ISK ecosystem of software. We develop software and platforms that would bring educators, researchers and students to the next level of communication and help the science community become more decentralized and modern. This means that our tools would have a special case for themselves. Because of this we seek to develop packages and libraries that would enhance our development of the platforms.  

## Description
Runik is a typescript package that helps with building an editor in the web environment. It is meta by not being the editor, but being interfaces, and rules that would enable a developer, implement an editor inside an application with its own theme, logic, rendering, and block options.
