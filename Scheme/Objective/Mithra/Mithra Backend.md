# Mithra Backend

## Overview
Mithra back-end [repo](https://github.com/iskdevelop/mithra-backend) is the main repository of Backend implementation of mithra. It handles users, meetings, and presentations live interactions.
## Investigation
- [ ] **Explore the codebase**: 
  Since we've been long apart from what the serverside program is I think a fair amount of time should be given into looking at the codebase and planning properly.
- [ ] **Implementation of REST apis**: As [[Mithra Design]] has already investigated our modules initial steps, we should implement the main rest apis that would let the project get on its feet.
- [ ] **Research and Development**: A fair amount of time should be dedicated to look at examples and implementation methods of meetings, websocket, hooks, and other types of live communication methods.
