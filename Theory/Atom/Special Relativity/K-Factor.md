# K-Factor
## Overview
The approach of the [[K-Calculus]] is to dispense with the [[Rigidity | rigid ruler]] and use radar methods for measuring distances. In the radar method, and observer measures the distance of an object by sending out a light signal which is reflected off the object and received back by the observer. The distance is then simply:

$$
\text{distance} = \frac{t_f - t_i}{2}
$$


> [!NOTE] Note
> By this method, the speed of light is automatically one and distances are measured in intervals of time, like the light year or the light seconds.

## Development


### **Two Observers Sending Signals**
Assume that we have to inertial observers $A$, and $B$. Observer $A$ starts off by sending light signals towards $B$, where the intervals between the signals is $T$ according to $A$'s clock. It is safe to assume that the signals would reach observer $B$ by the intervals that are proportional to $T$. Therefore:

$$
T_B = kT_A
$$
We now assume that if $A$ and $B$ are inertial observers, then the $k$-factor is a constant in time and independent of $T$. 

We also go further to assume that it is independent of the point in spacetime as well. From a mathematical point of view, this is the assumption that spacetime is **homogeneous** (it's the same at every point).

From $B$'s point of view, $A$ is moving away from $B$ with the same relative speed. Therefore, the principle of special relativity implies that the relationship between $A$ and $B$ must be reciprocal.

### **$B$'s Point of View**

If $B$ emits two signals with a time lapse of $T$ according to $B$'s clock, then we expect $A$ to also receive them with $kT$ intervals according to his clock. Note that here we have a hidden assumption. We assumed that the spacetime is **isotropic**, meaning that it does not prefer any direction to another.

### **Events in Spacetime**

For an observer $A$ using the radar method, coordinates of an [[Event]] $(t,x)$ would be found by sending light to bounce off of it and returning. For example assume an event $P$. Observer $A$ would send a signal at $t=t_1$ and the signal would return at $t=t_2$. Now since we agreed that the spacetime is homogeneous and isotropic. the time of event $P$ is exactly the middle of $t_1$ and $t_2$. 

$$ t_p = \frac12 (t_1+t_2) $$
On the other hand it's position is half the time light spent going the trip (to $P$ and back to $A$).

$$ x_p =\frac12 (t_2-t_1) $$
therefore,

$$
\boxed{(t_p,x_p)= \frac12 (t_1+t_2,t_2-t_1)}
$$
