# Lorentz's Ether Theory
## Overview
An ingenious explanation of the [[Michelson-Morley Experiment]]null results was found by FitzGerald in 1889. He suggested that the lengths of bodies moving through ether at velocity $v$ contract in the direction of their motion by a factor 

$$
\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}
$$

which would just compensate for the ether drift in the Michelson-Morley apparatus. Three years later Lorentz made the same hypothesis and incorporate it into his even more comprehensive ether theory.
