# Runik Vue Module
## Overview

Runik is a package ([[Runik Core Module|more]]), as we're building it we need to test and also provide implementation in Vue as our primarly framework of front-end developments. This objective focuses on building Runik for Vue.
## Investigation
- [ ] **A simple sandbox for testing**: 
      we need to first build a sandbox for testing how Runik works in vue. This is for the fact that we have not yet worked and properly tested the module #backlog.
- [ ] **Vue package:** 
      We should be able to provide a simple solution to build an editor using Runik very fast #backlog. 
- [ ] **Testing Themes**: 
      after the release of themes in Runik we must test them in vue package as well #backlog.
