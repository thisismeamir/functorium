# Electromagnetism before 17th century (Historical overview)
## Overview

## Development
- The science of electricity and magnetism is much younger than mechanics and optics. 
- Despite that phenomena regarding these were known from early ages of history
- Antiquity contributed nothing beyond the word *magnet* and some elementary observations concerning rubbed amber. 
- Compass can be traced to at least the second century A.D. in China and which was brought to Europe in the thirteenth century.
- The middle Ages added only the discovery that every part of a magnet again constitutes a whole magnet.
- Even the first century and a half of physics (after the philosophical point of view) contributes little to none to this field.
	- Despite the unquestioned services of William Gilbert (1540-01603) who coined the term *electricity*.
		- Gilbert traced out the course of the lines of force by bringing a small compass needle near magnetized steel balls, thus demonstrating the complete analogy to the action of the earth on the compass.
	- Studies of Otto von Guericke, showed the repulsion of like-charged particles, and constructed the first frictional electrical machine, and also discovered that iron filings can be magnetized merely by the action of the terrestrial magnetic field.
