# Research

## Overview
This is the hub, where we explore our research in numerical relativity.
## Investigation
- [ ] **Working Towards Kosmos:
      In summer we're planning to build Kosmos. A complete set of toolkits for numerical relativity, and numerical cosmology. For this we have to have a clear review on other codes, and other implementation. What things we can adopt from them? What things are not necessarily good. We should clear up this asap.
