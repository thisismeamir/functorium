# Einstein Atlas
## Context
General relativity is a vast subject in modern science and physics. It is in my opinion useful to have an atlas of our known knowledge of the universe in a structured manner. This would help people get data quickly, having a catalog of different metrics, coordinates, transformations, and all stuff related to general relativity solutions and approximations. 

## Description
I have added a detailed document at [Einstein Atlas](https://github.com/iskresearch/einstein-atlas).
