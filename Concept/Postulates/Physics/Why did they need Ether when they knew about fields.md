# Why did they need Ether when they knew about fields
## Context
While reading about [[Luminiferous Ether]] and [[Michelson-Morley Experiment]].

## Description

What was the reason to believe that you need a medium for light, when you found it to be electromagnetic waves.

If you only found that light is a wave, it is logical to look for a medium. But if you found out that your electromagnetic field oscillations are light, then why would you look for a medium? since you already accepted the existence of the fields.
