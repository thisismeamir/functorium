# Galilean Transformation
## Overview

Newtonian theory postulates the existence of preferred [[Classical Frame of Reference | Frame of Reference]]. The existence of these is essentially implied by [[First Law of Newtonian Mechanics]]

Once we have found one inertial frame (which will discuss how to find one here [[Finding an Inertial Frame]]). It's easy to find all the other frames with the same quality. We'd just look for stationary or constant speed moving frames with respect to the original inertial frame.

**Galilean transformation** is the transformation that connects one inertial frame, with another. 
## Development

Let's assume two inertial frames of reference $S$ and $S'$ in [[Standard Configuration]].  We would also consider that the observers in those frames had already synchronized their clocks. They put the origin of time when $S,S'$ are overlapping. The Galilean transformation connecting these two frames would therefore be:

$$
\begin{matrix}
x'=x+vt , &y'=y,&z'=z,&t'=t
\end{matrix}
$$
The last equation provides a manifestation of the assumption of [[Absolute Time]] in [[Newtonian Framework]].
