# 11-05-2025
- Installed Arch Linux. 
- I think it's gonna be a hard yet enjoying experience. 
- Now, it's time to focus on work. 
- And there's a LOT of works to do from now on. 
- But I think I would be able to manage it. 
- Starting to plan my week and go on to plan my year once again and try to hit the bars from now on. 
- I only wasted on month... so what? 
- We can always become better, and becoming 90% better is better than not getting better.
