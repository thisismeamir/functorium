# Speed of Light as a Constant
## Overview

The constancy of the speed of light has been extensively experimentally verified, confirming the fundamental nature of this concept. However, when Einstein formulated his theory of special relativity in 1905, these experiments did not yet exist. Instead, he relied on philosophical considerations to justify the second postulate, which posits that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.


> [!IMPORTANT] Constancy of Velocity of Light
> The velocity of light is the same in all inertial systems.

Here, we rephrase the second postulate in the following form:

>*"The speed of light, c, is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This means that the speed of light is an absolute constant, unaffected by the observer's frame of reference or their state of motion."*

Einstein's adoption of this postulate was a crucial step in the development of [[Model of Special Relativity | special relativity]], as it allowed him to derive many of the theory's famous consequences, including time dilation and length contraction. The second postulate has since been experimentally verified numerous times, further solidifying its place as a cornerstone of modern physics.
