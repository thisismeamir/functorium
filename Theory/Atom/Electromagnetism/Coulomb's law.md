# Coulomb's law
## Overview
Coulomb's law is an empirical rule for classical electromagnetism, stating the relation of the force between two electric charges.
## Development
The force between electrical charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ with distance $r$ from one another is empirically found to be:
$$
F_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
$$
where $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}$ is a constant to be determined.
