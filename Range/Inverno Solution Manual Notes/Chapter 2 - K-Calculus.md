# Problem 2.1
**Statement**: *Write down the Galilean transformation from observer S to observer S′, where S′ has velocity v1 relative to S. Find the transformation from S′ to S and state in simple terms how the transformations are related. Write down the Galilean transformation from S′ to S′′ where S′′ has velocity v2 relative to S′. Find the transformation from S to S′′. Prove that the Galilean transformations form an Abelian (commutative) group.*
