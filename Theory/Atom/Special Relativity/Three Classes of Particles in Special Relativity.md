# Three Classes of Particles in Special Relativity
## Overview
From the composition law, we can show that, if we add two speeds less than the speed of light, then we again obtain a speed less than the speed of light. This does not mean, as is sometimes stated, that nothing can move faster than the speed of light in special relativity, but rather that the speed of light is a border which can not be crossed or even reached. 
## Development

We have three classes of particles:

1. Particles that move slower than the speed of light are called subluminal particles. They include material particles and elementary particles such as electrons and neutrons.
2. Particles that move with the speed of light are called luminal particles. They include the carrier of electromagnetic field interaction, the photon, other zero rest-mass particles and theoretically, the carrier of gravitational field interaction, called graviton.
3. Particles that move faster than the speed of light are called superluminal particles or tachyons. There was some excitement in the 1970s surrounding the possible existence of tachyons, but all attempts to detect them to date have failed. This suggests two likely possibilities: either they don't exist, or they don't interact with ordinary matter.
