# Michelson-Morley Experiment
## Overview
The success of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism made the ether as such a central object of study and debate in late nineteenth-century physics. There was considerable pressure on experiments to try to observe it directly. In 1881 Michelson and Morley decided to put to the test the [[Luminiferous Ether]] hypotheses.
## Development
### Explanation
They split a bean of light and sent it along orthogonal paths of equal length and back again, whereupon interference fringes were produced between the returning beams. Different ether wind components along the two paths should have led to a difference in travel times. However, when the apparatus was rotated through $90^\degree$, so that this difference should be reversed, the expected displacement of the fringes did not occur.

By calculating some numbers one would understand that the effects could be perceived (if existed) through the apparatus. The most obvious defense is that the earth is dragging with ether itself, which can be ruled out because of the various optical phenomena that has been observed.
