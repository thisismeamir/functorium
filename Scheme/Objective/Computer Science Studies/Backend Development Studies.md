# Backend Development Studies

## Overview
## Investigation

#### üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Building REST APIs with Production Structure

- [ ]  **Create a REST API in Kotlin with Ktor (or Java Spring if necessary)**
    
- [ ]  **Design a layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)**
    
- [ ]  **Use DTOs for communication**
    
- [ ]  **Configure logging and exception handling properly**
    
- [ ]  **Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation**
    

#### üóÉÔ∏è Phase 2: Relational Database Mastery

- [ ]  **Install and use PostgreSQL (or MariaDB/MySQL as alt)**
    
- [ ]  **Model real-world schemas with proper normalization**
    
- [ ]  **Master SQL: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, indexing**
    
- [ ]  **Understand Transactions and Isolation Levels**
    
- [ ]  **Use ORM (Hibernate/JPA or Kotlin Exposed DSL) effectively**
    
- [ ]  **Write efficient queries with query plans**
    

---

#### üîÑ Phase 3: Authentication & Security in Backend

- [ ]  **Implement JWT-based authentication**
    
- [ ]  **Secure API routes with role-based access**
    
- [ ]  **Use HTTPS and understand TLS basics**
    
- [ ]  **Handle input validation and escaping (SQLi, XSS protection)**
    
- [ ]  **Build token refresh and expiration logic**
    
- [ ]  **Rate limiting (e.g., using Redis or middleware)**
    

---

#### üßµ Phase 4: Async, Concurrency, and Multithreading

- [ ]  **Use Kotlin Coroutines (`suspend`, `flow`, `channel`) properly**
    
- [ ]  **Understand thread pools and context propagation**
    
- [ ]  **Benchmark coroutines vs threads**
    
- [ ]  **Handle shared resources (mutex, atomic counters)**
    
- [ ]  **Design concurrent-safe service layers**
    

---

#### üì° Phase 5: C++ Backend Systems & Low-Level Backend

- [ ]  **Write a REST API in C++ using `cpp-httplib` or `crowcpp`**
    
- [ ]  **Use libpqxx to connect PostgreSQL to your C++ backend**
    
- [ ]  **Understand raw sockets and TCP/IP**
    
- [ ]  **Implement custom memory allocators and pools**
    
- [ ]  **Write multithreaded code with `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`**
    
- [ ]  **Build a custom web server handling multiple clients**
    

---

#### üß† Phase 6: Advanced Data Design & Storage

- [ ]  **Design schema for analytical workloads (OLAP)**
    
- [ ]  **Use JSONB in PostgreSQL for semi-structured data**
    
- [ ]  **Study normalization vs denormalization tradeoffs**
    
- [ ]  **Handle migrations properly (Flyway or Liquibase)**
    
- [ ]  **Experiment with caching reads (Redis or in-memory)**
    

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 7: Caching and Performance Tuning

- [ ]  **Integrate Redis for caching and pub/sub**
    
- [ ]  **Use Redis to cache queries and sessions**
    
- [ ]  **Profile SQL queries and reduce n+1 problems**
    
- [ ]  **Benchmark API endpoints (JMH for JVM, Google Benchmark for C++)**
    
- [ ]  **Enable HTTP compression, connection pooling, and keep-alive**
    
- [ ]  **Preload frequently accessed data in memory**
    

---

#### üì¨ Phase 8: Message Queues and Async Processing

- [ ]  **Use RabbitMQ or Kafka to queue long tasks**
    
- [ ]  **Design pub/sub consumers for notification systems**
    
- [ ]  **Implement background job processing system**
    
- [ ]  **Handle retries, DLQ (Dead Letter Queues), and backpressure**
    

---

#### üìú Phase 9: Protocol Buffers & gRPC

- [ ]  **Define `.proto` schemas**
    
- [ ]  **Generate gRPC clients and servers in Kotlin and C++**
    
- [ ]  **Compare gRPC vs REST performance**
    
- [ ]  **Use streaming RPCs for real-time data exchange**
    
- [ ]  **Secure gRPC with TLS**
    

---

#### üß¨ Phase 10: System Design & Scalable Backend Thinking

- [ ]  **Design REST APIs for real-world systems (e.g., ride sharing, auth service, etc.)**
    
- [ ]  **Split a monolith into microservices (theoretical & practical)**
    
- [ ]  **Design idempotent services and retry logic**
    
- [ ]  **Apply event sourcing or CQRS in system designs**
    
- [ ]  **Work on performance under load (throttling, bulkheads, etc.)**
    

---

#### üöß Phase 11: Build & Document Serious Projects
- [ ]  **Build a real knowledge API backend (auth, search, versioned content)**
 
 - [ ] **Implement a gRPC-based trading engine in C++**

- [ ]  **Create an async backend with Kotlin handling thousands of concurrent users**

- [ ] **Document your architecture with diagrams and markdown**

- [ ] **Package and share your backend libraries or services**
